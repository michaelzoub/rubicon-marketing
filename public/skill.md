# Rubicon For AI Agents

Rubicon lets an AI agent read paid articles one word at a time. The buyer agent
opens a budgeted session, pays for each delivered word, stops when it has enough
information, and receives a final receipt. Use the SDK for normal integrations;
do not hand-wire the HTTP session/payment/abort routes unless the user asks for
a custom protocol test.

## Decision Flow

When a user asks you to test or integrate Rubicon:

1. **Use the SDK first** — prefer `@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk` and
   `rubicon.run(...)` for the full flow.
2. **Use local SDK installs for local tests** — if the package is not published,
   install it from the local repo path instead of npm.
3. **Pass the gateway URL explicitly** — use the hosted Rubicon gateway
   `https://rubicon-caligagateway-production.up.railway.app` unless the user is
   deliberately running a local gateway.
4. **Use lower-level SDK methods only for custom flows** — `startSession`,
   `payForWord`, `abort`, and `streamEvents` exist, but the happy path is
   `run(...)`.

## Quick Start: Local Gateway + Local SDK

From the Rubicon repo:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk build
GATEWAY_PORT=8080 pnpm dev:gateway
```

Keep the gateway running.

From the agent project that should consume Rubicon:

```bash
pnpm add /Users/michaelzoubkoff/Documents/rubicon/packages/agent-sdk
```

Then run:

```ts
import Rubicon from "@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk";

const rubicon = new Rubicon({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
});

const receipt = await rubicon.run({
  articleId: "rubicon-streaming-001",
  goal: "Find the resale-fee clause",
  maxSpendAtomic: "20000",
  onWord: (word) => {
    process.stdout.write(`${word} `);
  },
});

console.log("\nreceipt:", receipt);
```

Expected result: words stream to stdout, followed by a receipt containing
`sessionId`, `articleId`, `wordsRead`, `amountPaidAtomic`, `payments`,
`transactionHashes`, `text`, `completed`, and `stopReason`.

## Agent Wallet Setup

Rubicon assumes the buyer is an agent with its own wallet. Before attempting a
paid read, configure the wallet, confirm it has enough testnet or production
USDC for the approved budget, and pass the wallet-backed payment engine into
the SDK. Never use a user's personal key implicitly; use an agent-owned key or
an agent wallet service the user has explicitly configured.

For Circle x402 settlement, set the agent wallet environment:

```bash
RUBICON_PAYMENTS=circle
CIRCLE_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
CIRCLE_RPC_URL=https://...
CIRCLE_FACILITATOR_URL=https://gateway-api-testnet.circle.com
CIRCLE_X402_NETWORKS=eip155:5042002
```

Then create the buyer with a wallet-backed payment engine:

```ts
import Rubicon, { CircleGatewayPaymentEngine } from "@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk";

const paymentEngine = new CircleGatewayPaymentEngine({
  chain: "arcTestnet",
  privateKey: process.env.CIRCLE_PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`,
  rpcUrl: process.env.CIRCLE_RPC_URL,
});

const rubicon = new Rubicon({
  baseUrl: process.env.RUBICON_GATEWAY_URL ?? "https://rubicon-caligagateway-production.up.railway.app",
  authorization: process.env.RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY
    ? `Bearer ${process.env.RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY}`
    : undefined,
  paymentEngine,
});
```

The end-to-end buyer flow is:

1. Confirm the user's maximum budget for this specific request.
2. Use the agent wallet to call the x402-protected Rubicon backend endpoint.
3. Let the gateway communicate with the article's seller agent to find useful
   sections and negotiate what to reveal next.
4. Open a paid stream and pay word by word from the agent wallet.
5. Stop and close the stream as soon as the user's goal is satisfied, the
   stop condition matches, or the approved budget would be exceeded.
6. Return the final receipt, including words read, amount paid, payment
   receipts, transaction hashes, completion state, and stop reason.

Prefer `rubicon.run(...)` for this lifecycle. It handles seller-agent
conversation, x402 payment headers, streaming words, budget enforcement, abort,
and receipt collection. Use `rubicon.read(...)` or lower-level methods only
when the user asks to inspect or customize a specific part of the protocol.

## Quick Start: Published SDK

When `@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk` is published, install it normally:

```bash
pnpm add @rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk
```

Use the hosted gateway URL provided by the user or environment:

```ts
import Rubicon from "@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk";

const rubicon = new Rubicon({
  baseUrl: process.env.RUBICON_GATEWAY_URL ?? "https://rubicon-caligagateway-production.up.railway.app",
  authorization: process.env.RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY
    ? `Bearer ${process.env.RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY}`
    : undefined,
});

const receipt = await rubicon.run({
  articleId: "rubicon-streaming-001",
  goal: "Find the resale-fee clause",
  maxSpendAtomic: "20000",
});
```

## SDK Surface

Primary method:

```ts
rubicon.run({
  articleId,
  goal,
  maxSpendAtomic,
  stopWhen,
  onWord,
  onEvent,
});
```

Streaming method:

```ts
for await (const event of rubicon.read(options)) {
  // session.started, seller.message, article.word, article.usage, article.completed
}
```

Lower-level methods for custom flows:

```ts
rubicon.getRepository()
rubicon.getNavigation(articleId, goal)
rubicon.startConversation(input)
rubicon.sendConversationMessage(conversationId, message)
rubicon.startSession(request)
rubicon.payForWord(sessionId, payment)
rubicon.abort(sessionId, reason)
rubicon.streamEvents(sessionId, onEvent)
```

`payForWord` returns one released word plus a per-word `payment` receipt. The
same receipt is mirrored in the gateway's `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` header.

## Payment Modes

Development mode uses `StaticPaymentEngine` and settles no real funds. This is
the default when no payment engine is passed.

Production/testnet settlement uses `CircleGatewayPaymentEngine`:

```ts
import Rubicon, { CircleGatewayPaymentEngine } from "@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk";

const rubicon = new Rubicon({
  baseUrl: process.env.RUBICON_GATEWAY_URL ?? "https://rubicon-caligagateway-production.up.railway.app",
  authorization: process.env.RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY
    ? `Bearer ${process.env.RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY}`
    : undefined,
  paymentEngine: new CircleGatewayPaymentEngine({
    chain: "arcTestnet",
    privateKey: process.env.CIRCLE_PRIVATE_KEY as `0x${string}`,
    rpcUrl: process.env.CIRCLE_RPC_URL,
  }),
});
```

## Hosted Gateway Environment

On Railway, set:

```bash
RUBICON_GATEWAY_URL=https://rubicon-caligagateway-production.up.railway.app
RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY=your-shared-buyer-agent-secret
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
RUBICON_PAYMENTS=circle
CIRCLE_FACILITATOR_URL=https://gateway-api-testnet.circle.com
CIRCLE_X402_NETWORKS=eip155:5042002
```

`RUBICON_AGENT_API_KEY` protects the Rubicon HTTP API. `OPENAI_API_KEY` powers
the hosted seller agent's navigation/conversation model.

## Buyer Budget Confirmation

Before starting a paid Rubicon read, ask the user what maximum budget they
approve for the specific article/data request. Do not guess the budget, infer it
from wallet balance, or start paying just because credentials are configured.
Use the user's confirmed limit as `maxSpendAtomic` or `budget.maxAmountAtomic`,
and stop as soon as the task is satisfied or the approved budget would be
exceeded.

## Troubleshooting

If the gateway fails with `EADDRINUSE`, the port is already in use. Pick another
port and use the same URL in the SDK:

```bash
GATEWAY_PORT=8790 pnpm dev:gateway
```

```ts
const rubicon = new Rubicon({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8790",
});
```

If the agent project cannot resolve `@rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk`, install the
local SDK path for local testing:

```bash
pnpm add /Users/michaelzoubkoff/Documents/rubicon/packages/agent-sdk
```

If SDK behavior or types are stale, rebuild the SDK in the Rubicon repo, then
reinstall it in the agent project:

```bash
pnpm --filter @rubicon-caliga/agent-sdk build
```

If the request is about the raw HTTP protocol, see the gateway endpoints:

- `GET /v1/repository`
- `GET /v1/articles/:articleId/navigation`
- `POST /v1/seller-agent/conversations`
- `POST /v1/sessions`
- `POST /v1/sessions/:sessionId/payments`
- `GET /v1/sessions/:sessionId/events`
- `POST /v1/sessions/:sessionId/abort`
